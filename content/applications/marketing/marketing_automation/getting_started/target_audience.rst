==================
Target an audience
==================

Getting marketing campaigns to the *right* audience is paramount when trying to grow a business.
Fortunately, the :guilabel:`Odoo Marketing Automation` application provides the right tools to take
marketing strategies to the next level.

Work with target filters
========================

When configuring the filters on a marketing campaign, there are some options that have an arrow
icon beside them, this signifies the parameter has more variables within it.

More than one parameter line can be configured. A :guilabel:`node (+)` can be added under what is
called a :guilabel:`branch (â€¦)`. To add a node, click on the :guilabel:`+` (plus sign icon) and to
add another branch click on the :guilabel:`...` (ellipses icon).

To exclude a :guilabel:`node` (or a :guilabel:`branch`), click on :guilabel:`Delete node (x)`.

Every time a new branch is created, there are two options, either the records can match
:guilabel:`all` criteria for the upcoming rules, or the records can match :guilabel:`any` (meaning
one rule or the other). To change between these two options, simply click the drop-down arrow icon 
in the green box and select :guilabel:`Any` or :guilabel:`All`.
