==================
Chapter 7: Testing
==================

Automatically testing code is important when working on a codebase, to ensure that
we don't introduce (too many) bugs or regressions. Let us see how to test our
code.

Integration testing
=======================

To make sure our application works as expected, we can test a business flow with
a tour: this is a sequence of steps that we can execute. Each step wait until
some desired DOM state is reached, then performs an action. If at some point, it
is unable to go to the next step for a long time, the tour fails.

Let's write a tour to ensure that it is possible to perform an tshirt order,
from our public route


- Add a ``/static/tests/tours`` folder
- Add a ``/static/tests/tours/order_flow.js`` file
- Add a tour that performs the following steps:

  - open the ``/awesome_tshirt/order`` route
  - fill the order form
  - validate it
  - navigate to our webclient
  - open the list view for the the t-shirt order
  - check that our order can be found in the list

- Run the tour manually
- Add a python test to run it also
- Run the tour from the terminal

Unit testing a Component
============================

It is also useful to test independantly a component or a piece of code. Unit
tests are useful to quickly locate an issue.


- Add a ``static/tests/counter_tests.js`` file
- Add a QUnit test that instantiate a counter, clicks on it, and make sure it is
  incremented

Unit testing our gallery view
=================================

.. note::
  This depends on our Gallery View from before.

Many components needs more setup to be tested. In particular, we often need to
mock some demo data. Let us see how to do that.


- Add a ``/static/tests/gallery_view_tests.js`` file
- Add a test that instantiate the gallery view with some demo data
- Add another test that check that when the user clicks on an image, it is switched
  to the form view of the corresponding order.
